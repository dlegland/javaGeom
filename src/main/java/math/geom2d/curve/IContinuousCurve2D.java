/**
 * Interface for all curves which can be drawn with one stroke. This includes closed curves (ellipses, polygon boundaries...), infinite curves (straight lines, parabolas, ...), and 'finite' curves, such as polylines, conic arcs, line segments, splines... Note that an hyperbola is compound of 2 continuous curves.
 * <p>
 * Such curves accept parametric representation, in the form : <code>p(t)={x(t),y(t)}</code>, with <code>t</code> contained in appropriate domain. Bounds of domain of definition can be obtained by methods <code>t0()</code> and <code>t1()</code>.
