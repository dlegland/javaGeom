/**
 * <p>
 * Main interface for all geometric objects, including points, lines, curves, or planar regions... Instances of Shape2D can be either bounded (a point, a line segment, a square...) or unbounded (a parabola, a half-plane...).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Shape2D implementations implements a more specialized interface depending on the shape inner dimension: {@link math.geom2d.curve.ICurve2D Curve2D}, {@link math.geom2d.domain.IDomain2D Domain2D} or {@link math.geom2d.point.IPointShape2D PointShape2D}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Shape2D interface provide convenient method to check if the shape {@link #isEmpty() is empty}, to {@link #transform(AffineTransform2D) transform} or to {@link #clip(Box2D) clip} the shape, get its {@link #boundingBox() bounding box}, or its {@link #distance(Point2D) distance} to a given point.
