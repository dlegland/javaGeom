 * <p> 
 * Main interface for all geometric objects, including points, lines, curves,
 * or planar regions... Instances of Shape2D can be either bounded
 * (a point, a line segment, a square...) or unbounded (a parabola,
 * a half-plane...).</p>
 * <p>
 * Shape2D implementations implements a more specialized interface depending 
 * on the shape inner dimension:
 * {@link net.javageom.geom2d.curve.Curve2D Curve2D}, 
 * {@link net.javageom.geom2d.domain.Domain2D Domain2D} or
 * {@link net.javageom.geom2d.point.PointShape2D PointShape2D}.</p>
 * <p>
 * Shape2D interface provide convenient method to check if the shape
 * {@link #isEmpty() is empty}, to {@link #transform(AffineTransform2D) 
 * transform} or to {@link #clip(Box2D) clip} the shape, get its
 * {@link #boundingBox() bounding box}, or its
 * {@link #distance(Point2D) distance} to a given point.</p>
