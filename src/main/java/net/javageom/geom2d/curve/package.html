<p>Curves interface hierarchy, and implementations of curve sets and various poly-curves.</p> 

<p>Contains the definition of Curve2D, the main interface for curves, and
several specialisations: ContinuousCurve2D, which is continuous, and
SmoothCurve2D, which defines tangent and curvature at each point.</p>

<p>The interface OrientedCurve2D defines curves which can decide whether a
point is inside or outside their domain. Continuous and smooth oriented curves
are defined by classes ContinuousOrientedCurve and SmoothOrientedCurve2D
respectively.<p>

<p>Curves can be combined to form a CurveSet2D. If the curves of curveset are
continuous and linked each other, a PolyCurve2D can be used.<p>

<p>Curves can be used to define boundary of domain. Such curves must be
instances of BoundaryCurve2D, which are either sets of OrientedCurve2D, or
single ContinuousOrientedCurve2D.</p>
