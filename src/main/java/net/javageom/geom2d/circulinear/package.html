<p>Definition of circulinear shapes and some implementations.</p> 

<p>
Circulinear shapes are composed only of pieces of lines and circles: circle
arcs, line segments, rays... They have many interests:
<ul>
<li>their length can be computed easily (if they are bounded)</li>
<li>they can be transformed using 
    {@link math.geom2d.transform.CircleInversion2D#CircleInversion2D(Circle2D) circle inversion} </li>
<li>they can be used to represent <b>exactly</b> (i.e. without polygonal
    approximation) the buffer of a circulinear shape.</li>
</ul>
