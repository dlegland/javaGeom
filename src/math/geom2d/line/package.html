Implementations of 'linear shapes', i.e. curves which can be embedded into a
straight lines, like {@link StraightLine2D straight lines}, 
{@link LineSegment2D line segments}, or {@link Ray2D rays}.
The base interface is {@link LinearShape2D}. 
The class {@link AbstractLine2D} is an implementation skeleton for several
other linear shapes.</p>
